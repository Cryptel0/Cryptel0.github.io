    <p>It’s wild how much of a difference doing the homework makes.</p>
    <p>Projects that really understand their market and build based on feedback have a 60% better chance of sticking around long-term.<br />
    Plus, those who do solid market research usually raise around 40% more funds early on.</p>
    <p>This isn’t some slick product or founder-led marketing trick. It’s a business ethic — you look up, listen to the market.</p>

    <h2>The Myth of the Secret Founder and Untested Big Tech</h2>
    <p>Yet there’s this myth many founders still cling to: keep everything hidden, then suddenly pop out with what they call the “next big tech.”<br />
    Honestly, it’s funny. Most times, those “big tech” products are rough ideas born from minimal research, no competitor analysis, and tons of unprocessed data.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Lessons from Early Web3 Projects</h2>
    <p>Let’s rewind back to the early web3 days. Things were way simpler then.<br />
    You spot a pain point like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“How do we make NFTs actually usable?”</li>
      <li>“How do we make DeFi less scary and more approachable?”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And boom — you build a quick fix.</p>
    <p>Competition wasn’t insane yet, so standing out was easier.<br />
    But many early projects acted like they represented the whole community, missing obvious gaps.<br />
    Then newer projects swooped in, patched those gaps, and dropped a better version of the same idea.</p>
    <p>It’s like remix culture or forking in the crypto space — constant iteration.</p>
    <p>Want a case study? CryptoKitties.<br />
    The OG NFT hit that was hype but hit major scaling issues.<br />
    Then Axie Infinity came along:<br />
    Nailed the gameplay, tokenomics, and community engagement.<br />
    Boom — exploded bigger.<br />
    Same space, just better iteration.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Community: The Fuel That Fires Projects</h2>
    <p>But now?<br />
    Building in web3 is a whole different ballgame.</p>
    <p>It’s all about community, audience, and users.</p>
    <p>A 2025 report found that around 75% of web3 startups now treat market research and competitor analysis as must-haves before they drop anything.<br />
    No more secret-building caves!<br />
    They pull communities in early with testnets, DAO votes, and open feedback sessions.</p>
    <p>The community is the fuel that fires projects nowadays.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Your Customers</h2>
    <p>And it makes sense, right?<br />
    To build something killer, you gotta understand your customers — not just what they want, but how they behave, what drives them, their demographics, and psychographics.<br />
    Basically, the full picture.</p>
    <p>That’s how you avoid building just for yourself and build for the real people who’ll use your product.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Market Segmentation and Trends</h2>
    <p>Then there’s the bigger picture:<br />
    Market size, growth rate, emerging trends.<br />
    Is this a small niche? Or a full-on wave growing every day?</p>
    <p>That insight helps you judge if you’re onto something worth investing in.</p>
    <p>You also gotta break down the market into segments —<br />
    Identifying groups who share traits.<br />
    Crypto newbies want simple UX. Power users want control and advanced features.<br />
    Knowing your groups means you can tailor your moves instead of guessing.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Testing Product Viability</h2>
    <p>And here’s the kicker — product or service viability.<br />
    You’ve got to test if people actually want or need your product.<br />
    Tech for tech’s sake rarely sticks.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Marketing and External Factors</h2>
    <p>Marketing?<br />
    It matters a ton.<br />
    You gotta measure what works, which campaigns bring users in, and which are just noise.<br />
    In web3, that means tracking community growth, engagement, token holders, even governance voters.</p>
    <p>Plus, don’t sleep on external factors —<br />
    Economy, social trends, tech advances, environment, politics, legal rules (PESTLE).<br />
    All shape the game and can make growth easier or harder.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Case Study: Uniswap</h2>
    <p>Look at Uniswap.<br />
    They didn’t just launch and chill.<br />
    They keep pumping out new versions, listen to community feedback through governance proposals and millions of data points, and grow bit by bit into a DeFi powerhouse with billions in daily volume.</p>
